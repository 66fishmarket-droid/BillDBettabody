EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION CATALOGUE — PATTERNS & TEMPO (v1.0)
============================================================

This catalogue defines all canonical loading patterns and tempo structures used
across strength training, hypertrophy, power, conditioning, running, cycling,
and mixed-modal prescriptions. Bill must treat these names as authoritative
identifiers.

Each pattern describes HOW sets or intervals are structured. Tempo describes
HOW movements are performed. Together, they create a clear and scientifically
grounded prescription model.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — STRENGTH PATTERN TYPES
============================================================

1) STRENGTH_FLAT
    All sets use the same load and reps.
    Used for general strength, hypertrophy, and machine work.

2) STRENGTH_RAMP_TO_TARGET
    Load increases each set toward a defined top weight.
    Used for strength peaking, technical warm-ups, and progressive loading.

3) STRENGTH_TOP_SET_BACKOFF
    One heavy top set followed by lighter back-off sets.
    Back-off percentage or decrement defined in pattern_notes.

4) STRENGTH_REVERSE_PYRAMID
    Heaviest set first, decreasing loads thereafter.
    Reps usually increase across sets.

5) STRENGTH_LINEAR_PYRAMID
    Loads increase from start → peak → decrease.
    Used for balanced strength-hypertrophy combinations.

6) STRENGTH_WARMUP_PLUS_FLAT_WORK
    First 1–2 sets ramp up, remaining sets use steady working load.

7) STRENGTH_DROP_SET
    One heavy set followed by rapid weight reductions without rest.
    Defines metabolic stress / hypertrophy emphasis.

8) STRENGTH_REST_PAUSE
    One main working load with multiple micro-sets separated by 10–30s rest.

9) STRENGTH_CLUSTER
    Heavy load broken into repeated mini-sets (e.g., 2+2+2+2).
    Intra-set rest defined in pattern_notes.

10) STRENGTH_EMOM
    Strength performed every minute on the minute.
    Load may be flat or ramping.

11) STRENGTH_AMRAP_SET
    One set performed for as many reps as possible at a fixed load.

============================================================
SECTION 2 — CARDIO / CONDITIONING PATTERN TYPES
============================================================

12) CARDIO_STEADY
    Continuous effort at fixed intensity (Z1–Z3 depending on target).

13) CARDIO_PROGRESSIVE
    Gradual increase in intensity from start to finish.

14) CARDIO_NEGATIVE_SPLIT
    First half easier, second half harder.

15) CARDIO_INTERVAL_REGULAR
    Repeated intervals with consistent work/rest durations.

16) CARDIO_INTERVAL_PROGRESSIVE
    Interval intensity increases through the workout.

17) CARDIO_FARTLEK_STRUCTURED
    Alternating fast and slow segments with structured timing.

18) CARDIO_HILL_REPEATS
    Repeated uphill intervals at high intensity.

19) CARDIO_TEMPO
    Continuous threshold-level effort at Z3–Z4.

20) CARDIO_TIME_TRIAL
    All-out performance over a defined time or distance.

21) CARDIO_RECOVERY_EASY
    Low-intensity recovery session at Z1–Z2.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — MIXED-MODAL / SKILL / MOBILITY PATTERN TYPES
============================================================

22) MOBILITY_SEQUENCE
    Defined sequence of mobility drills.

23) SKILL_PRACTICE_TECHNIQUE
    Technique, drills, gait work, neurological patterning.

24) MIXED_CIRCUIT_DENSITY
    Repeated rounds of mixed movements performed for time or density.

============================================================
SECTION 4 — TEMPO CODES & TEMPO ARCHETYPES
============================================================

Tempo notation: ECCENTRIC – PAUSE (BOTTOM) – CONCENTRIC – PAUSE (TOP)

Examples:
    3-0-1-0 = 3 seconds down, no pause, 1 second up, no pause  
    4-2-1-0 = slow eccentric, long pause  
    X-0-1-0 = explosive concentric (“X” = as fast as safely possible)

------------------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL TEMPO ARCHETYPES
------------------------------------------------------------

T1: TEMPO_CONTROLLED
    Default hypertrophy tempo. Usually 3-0-1-0.

T2: TEMPO_SLOW_ECCENTRIC
    Increased time under tension. 4-0-1-0, 5-0-1-0.

T3: TEMPO_PAUSED_BOTTOM
    Eliminates stretch reflex. 3-1-1-0 or 2-2-1-0.

T4: TEMPO_PAUSED_TOP
    Stability or positional control. 2-0-1-2.

T5: TEMPO_EXPLOSIVE_CONCENTRIC
    Power training. 3-0-X-0 or 2-0-X-0.

T6: TEMPO_SUPERCONTROLLED
    Rehab / motor learning. 4-2-2-1 or slower.

T7: TEMPO_SPEED_STRENGTH
    Quick eccentric, explosive concentric. 1-0-X-0.

T8: TEMPO_OLYMPIC
    Used in weightlifting derivatives. X-0-X-1 or similar.

------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPO APPLICATION RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
- Tempo applies per movement unless tempo_per_set_pattern overrides it.
- Beginners should see tempo explained in plain language.
- Intermediates see short reminders.
- Experts see only tempo codes unless detail_level_preference = detailed.
- Tempo influences training effect: hypertrophy, strength, stability, power.
