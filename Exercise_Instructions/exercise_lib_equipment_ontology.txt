Bill D’Bettabody – Exercise Library & Equipment Ontology

Design Decisions & Rationale (Working Record)

Purpose

This document records agreed design decisions for the Exercise Library and equipment ontology used by Bill D’Bettabody.
Its goal is to ensure safety, scalability, consistency, and long-term maintainability as Bill moves from sandbox to production.

This is a design reference, not an implementation guide.

1. Core Design Philosophy

The Exercise Library must support:

Commercial gyms

Home / zero-budget environments

Improvised environments (furniture, stairs, railings, etc.)

Adaptive and inclusive training contexts

Safety must be data-driven, not assumed.

Bill should never rely on implicit “common sense” about equipment.

Ontology must move from broad → narrow to support grouping, substitution, and reasoning.

2. Exercise Library Is Exercise-Centric

The library stores exercises, not equipment objects.

There are no rows for “chair”, “table”, or “door frame”.

Equipment context is expressed via:

equipment (broad class)

variant (specific setup)

safety_notes, regression, and progression

This prevents equipment sprawl and keeps programming logic stable.

3. Equipment Ontology (Top-Level Classes)

The following equipment classes are first-class and canonical:

none
True bodyweight, floor-based exercises

household
Domestic furniture or fixtures used for support or loading

free_weight
Dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, sandbags, backpacks, etc.

fixed_machine
Selectorised or plate-loaded machines

cable_system
Pulley-based resistance systems

portable_accessory
Bands, suspension trainers, sliders, medicine balls, etc.

cardio_machine
Stationary machines (treadmill, spin bike, rower, etc.)

human_powered_vehicle
Human propulsion through space (bicycles, handbikes, scooters, etc.)

environmental
Outdoor or built environment features (stairs, hills, playground bars)

4. Human-Powered Vehicle Rule (Explicit Boundary)

Definition:
A human-powered vehicle is any device where exercise stimulus is created by propelling the body and device through physical space.

Rule:

Moves through space → human_powered_vehicle

Stationary resistance → cardio_machine

Examples:

Road bike, MTB, handbike → human_powered_vehicle

Static exercise bike, wattbike → cardio_machine

Outdoor running → environmental

This distinction is intentional and must not be blurred.

5. Household Equipment Safety Model

Household equipment is defined by load-bearing characteristics, not trust in the object.

Design Rules

Use generic names (chair, table, wall, door frame)

Pair them with explicit safety characteristics

Always define unsafe red flags

Always include safe alternatives

Bill must default to alternatives if structural integrity cannot be verified.

6. Agreed Household / Environmental Definitions (v1)
Chair (sturdy)

No wheels, no swivel, rigid frame

Supports full bodyweight without flex

Not folding or heavily cushioned

Uses: incline push-ups, step-ups, assisted squats

Alternatives: stairs, bench, low wall

Table (solid)

Heavy, non-movable, no flex

No glass, no wheels

Uses: inverted rows, incline push-ups

Alternatives: suspension trainer, railing, playground bar

Wall (structural)

Brick, concrete, or stud wall

No loose fixtures, non-slippery

Uses: wall sits, wall push-ups, handstand holds

Alternatives: floor-based variations

Door Frame (structural – high risk)

Solid frame, firmly anchored hinges

Solid-core door only if used

No sliding, pocket, or glass doors

No movement under test load

Uses: assisted rows, isometric holds (advanced only)

Explicitly not for dynamic or kipping movements

Alternatives: suspension trainer, band rows, table rows

Stairs / Steps

Fixed, even height, non-slip

No loose carpet or damage

Uses: step-ups, split squats, calf raises

Alternatives: chair, box, lunges

Railings (support-only)

Firmly anchored, no wobble

Never treated as full load-bearing

Uses: assisted squats, balance support

Alternatives: wall, suspension trainer, chair

7. How This Appears in the Exercise Sheet
equipment

Always broad and machine-readable
Examples: household, environmental, human_powered_vehicle

variant

Encodes setup specificity
Examples:

incline_chair

row_table

step_stairs

row_doorframe

safety_notes

Mandatory for household/environmental exercises

Contains structural requirements and stop conditions

regression / progression

Always defined to provide safe downgrade and upgrade paths

This ensures Bill can substitute without hallucinating.

8. Repeatable Exercise Entry Pattern

Every exercise added should follow this order:

Clear, unambiguous exercise_name

Broad classification:

category

body_region

movement_pattern

equipment

Narrowed execution via variant

Safety metadata:

safety_notes

common_mistakes

regression

Logical progression

If Step 2 feels unclear, the exercise definition is probably weak.

9. Bill Behaviour (Design Intent – Not Yet Implemented)

When prescribing exercises with:

equipment = household or environmental

Bill should:

Surface one safety qualifier

Offer one alternative

Default to caution if context is unclear

This will be encoded later in Bill’s instructions.

10. Identified Backlog Items (Implicit)

Ingest Google Form session responses into client context

Allow Bill to reference athlete notes from form responses

Add explicit rule to Bill’s instructions for household/environmental safety qualifiers

Continue building Exercise Library content using the agreed pattern

Status:
This ontology and usage model is considered agreed and locked as a foundation for production build-out.
