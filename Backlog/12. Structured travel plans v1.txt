TITLE: Structured Travel_Plans sheet and travel-specific planning logic

STATUS: Backlog
PRIORITY: Medium

SUMMARY
-------
Move from a free-text "Upcoming Travel" blob in the Clients sheet to a
structured Travel_Plans sheet. This will make it easier for Make scenarios and
Bill to reason about travel periods, locations, and constraints when planning
blocks/weeks and adjusting sessions.

USER STORY
----------
As a client, I want Bill to remember my trips and adapt my training around
them (hotel gyms, holidays, long workdays), so that the plan feels realistic
and sustainable instead of ignoring the realities of travel.

DATA / MODEL IMPACT
-------------------
New sheet: Travel_Plans (name TBD, e.g. "Clients_Travel_Plans").

Proposed columns:
- trip_id                – Make-generated unique id (e.g. "trip_cli001_20260315")
- client_id              – foreign key to Clients sheet
- label                  – short name (e.g. "Barcelona work trip")
- location_text          – e.g. "Barcelona, Spain"
- start_date             – YYYY-MM-DD
- end_date               – YYYY-MM-DD
- context                – free text (e.g. "conference days, hotel gym unknown")
- status                 – "planned" | "active" | "completed" | "cancelled"
- created_at             – timestamp
- updated_at             – timestamp

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (MVP)
----------------------------
1) Create "Bill - Add Travel Plan" scenario:
   - Input via webhook:
     - client_id
     - label
     - location_text
     - start_date
     - end_date
     - context
   - Behaviour:
     - Generate trip_id.
     - Insert a new row into Travel_Plans with status = "planned".
     - Optionally also append/reflect this in Clients.Upcoming_Travel (for
       backwards compatibility and human readability).
     - Respond with status and trip_id.

2) Create "Bill - Update Travel Plan Status" scenario:
   - Input via webhook:
     - trip_id
     - new_status ("planned" | "active" | "completed" | "cancelled")
   - Behaviour:
     - Find the matching row in Travel_Plans.
     - Update status and updated_at.
     - (Optional) Remove or annotate corresponding line in Clients.Upcoming_Travel.

3) Extend "Bill - Load Client Context":
   - When assembling client context, also fetch Travel_Plans rows for:
     - client_id = requested client
     - status in ["planned", "active"]
   - Expose this as:
     - client_travel_plans: array of objects with (trip_id, label, location,
       start_date, end_date, context, status).
   - Bill can then use this structured travel info to:
     - Adjust block/week planning.
     - Adjust session content and constraints.
     - Select the correct location for weather calls.

SCENARIOS AFFECTED
------------------
- New: Bill - Add Travel Plan.
- New: Bill - Update Travel Plan Status.
- Existing: Bill - Load Client Context (read & include travel plans).
- Existing planning scenarios (block/week/session) to optionally consume
  the structured travel_plans array instead of (or in addition to)
  Clients.Upcoming_Travel.

TRANSITION / COMPATIBILITY
--------------------------
- Initially, keep Clients.Upcoming_Travel as a human-readable summary field.
- Gradually move Bill's reasoning to favour Travel_Plans as the source of truth.
- Optionally implement a one-way sync:
  - Travel_Plans → generate/refresh a rolling summary string into
    Clients.Upcoming_Travel for human inspection.

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
- Do we need per-trip equipment flags (e.g. "hotel gym", "no gym", "bike
  available") as structured columns now, or leave them in the context field?
- How should Bill handle overlapping trips or partially overlapping dates
  with planned blocks/weeks?
- When (if ever) do old completed travel plans get archived or removed?
