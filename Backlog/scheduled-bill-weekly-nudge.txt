TITLE: Weekly Auto-Nudge From Bill

DESCRIPTION:
Implement a scheduled reminder system for clients where Bill contacts them once per week:
"Hi, it’s Bill. I’m preparing next week's plan. Any travel, injuries, or schedule changes?"

- For real users, requires backend scheduler (Make / backend service).
- Should allow user reply → Bill triggers populate_training_week automatically.

DEPENDENCIES:

- client lookup action (future)
- authentication model for multi-user environments

STATUS:
Backlog

PRIORITY:
High (for commercial app)
