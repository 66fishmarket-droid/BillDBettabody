TITLE: Precision Nutrition Mode (Future Premium Feature)

DESCRIPTION:
Optional high-detail mode where Bill generates:
- Per-session targeted macros
- Glycogen periodisation
- Hydration/electrolyte planning
- Supplement timing guidance
- Caloric cycling for fat loss or hypertrophy

NOTES:
Requires:
- More detailed session metadata
- User coaching preference (“precision mode: on/off”)
- More complex GPT prompts and rules

STATUS:
Long-term backlog

PRIORITY:
Low for v1, high for commercial product roadmap

ADDITIONAL IDEAS:

Backlog item titles (clean, future-proof)

You don’t need to write them now, but conceptually:

NUTRITION_V2_MEAL_PLANS_SINGLE_PERSON

NUTRITION_V3_HOUSEHOLD_AWARE_GUIDANCE

NUTRITION_V3_FLEXIBLE_MACRO_APPROACH

NUTRITION_V3_COMPASSIONATE_COMPLIANCE_MODEL

When you eventually implement these, they’ll likely touch:

Section 2 (client context expansion)

Section 4 (nutrition logic deepening)

New action schemas (meal plans)

Possibly a new Section 5 (nutrition-specific outputs)
