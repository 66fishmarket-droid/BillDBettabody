TITLE: Weather-aware block/week planning and session adjustments

STATUS: Backlog
PRIORITY: Medium-High

SUMMARY
-------
Enable Bill to take local weather into account when planning blocks/weeks and
when adjusting individual sessions. The goal is for Bill to favour outdoor
sessions when conditions are good, and bias towards indoor / low-risk options
when conditions are poor (heavy rain, storms, extreme heat/cold).

USER STORY
----------
As a client, I want Bill to be aware of the weather where I am (or where I am
travelling), so that he can schedule and adjust sessions in a way that feels
realistic and enjoyable, rather than telling me to run in a thunderstorm or
miss a rare sunny day.

DATA / MODEL IMPACT
-------------------
- Home Location already added to Clients sheet (column AU).
- Upcoming Travel already added to Clients sheet (column AV).
- No new sheets required for MVP.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (MVP)
----------------------------
1) Create a reusable Make scenario: "Bill - Get Weather Context".
   - Input via custom webhook:
     - client_id
     - date (or date range)
     - optional: location_override (string)
   - Steps:
     - Look up client's Home Location from Clients sheet.
     - If location_override provided, use that instead.
     - Call a weather API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap) for the given date/location.
     - Derive a lightweight context object:
       - outdoor_ok (boolean)
       - conditions_summary (e.g. "cool, light cloud, low chance of rain")
       - key metrics (temp, rain probability, wind, etc.)
   - Output:
     - JSON body suitable for Bill to use in reasoning.

2) Integrate into weekly/block planning:
   - In the Full Training Block / Populate Training Week flows, optionally call
     "Bill - Get Weather Context" for each day (or for a representative subset).
   - Use outdoor_ok and conditions_summary to:
     - Prefer outdoor runs/rides/walks on good days.
     - Prefer indoor/gym/at-home sessions on bad days.
   - Capture minimal weather notes in Plans_Weeks or Plans_Sessions if useful.

3) Integrate into Session Updater (optional MVP extension):
   - Allow Bill to call "Bill - Get Weather Context" for "today" or "tomorrow"
     when re-planning a specific session.
   - If outdoor_ok is false:
     - Suggest swapping to indoor or alternative modalities.
   - If outdoor_ok is true and the plan is currently indoor:
     - Optionally suggest a nicer outdoor variant if it fits the block’s goals.

SCENARIOS AFFECTED
------------------
- Bill - Full Training Block Generator (read-only integration).
- Bill - Populate Training Week (read-only integration).
- New: Bill - Get Weather Context (weather microservice).
- Future: session delivery/presentation logic (for messaging).

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
- Which weather API to standardise on (OpenWeather vs others)?
- How many days ahead should we request details for in one call?
- Do we store any weather metadata in Sheets, or treat it as ephemeral context?
- How aggressively should Bill reschedule based on weather vs respecting
  strength/conditioning periodisation?
