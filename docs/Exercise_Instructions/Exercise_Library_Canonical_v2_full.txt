- Hips back

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Foundational hinge patterning drill.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The hip hinge drill is a foundational movement used to teach proper hip hinging mechanics, primarily
targeting the glutes and hamstrings while reinforcing a neutral spine. It is often used as a warm-up
or teaching exercise before loaded hinge movements such as deadlifts. To perform it, stand tall with
feet hip-width apart and soften the knees slightly. Push the hips straight back as if closing a door
with your glutes, keeping the chest tall and spine neutral. Allow the torso to lean forward
naturally while the hips move backward, then return to standing by squeezing the glutes and driving
the hips forward. The focus is on movement quality rather than load or speed. Context: Warm-

COACHING_CUES_SHORT:
- Sit between hips

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Bodyweight squat using full range of motion.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The air squat is a bodyweight squat that primarily targets the quadriceps and glutes while building
foundational lower-body strength and movement control. It is commonly used as a teaching tool, warm-
up, or conditioning movement because it requires no equipment. To perform it, stand with feet about
shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out if comfortable. Brace your core and initiate the
squat by bending hips and knees together, sitting down between your feet while keeping the chest
tall. Descend to a comfortable depth with knees tracking over toes and heels staying down, then
drive through the mid-foot and heels to return to standing with controlled posture. Context: Primary
pattern strength move. Can be a main lift or a key accessory depending on load and intent.

COACHING_CUES_SHORT:
- Control to box

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Squat to a box or chair to control depth.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The box squat is a squat variation performed by descending onto a box or bench set at a
predetermined height, primarily targeting the quadriceps and glutes while providing a clear depth
reference. It is useful for beginners, individuals rebuilding confidence at depth, or those managing
knee or hip limitations. To set up, place a sturdy box or bench behind you and stand in your normal
squat stance with feet shoulder-width apart. Brace your core and initiate the movement by sitting
your hips back toward the box while bending the knees. Lower under control until you lightly touch
the box without fully relaxing, then drive through your feet to stand back up. The box should act as
a reference point rather than a seat, and tension should be maintained throughout the movement.

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Squat holding weight at chest for counterbalance.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The goblet squat is a front-loaded squat variation performed while holding a single dumbbell or
kettlebell at chest height, primarily targeting the quadriceps and glutes while promoting an upright
torso. It is commonly used to teach squat mechanics, for home training, or as a lower-stress
alternative to barbell squats. To set up, hold the weight vertically against your chest with both
hands, elbows pointing down, and stand with feet roughly shoulder-width apart. Brace your core and
keep your chest tall before lowering into the squat by sitting hips down and back while bending the
knees. Allow the elbows to move inside the knees as you descend, aiming for a depth that feels
controlled and pain-free. Push the floor away to stand back up, keeping the weight close to the body
and the torso upright throughout. Context: Accessory strength move. Typically used to build weak
links, volume, or joint-friendly hypertrophy.

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Barbell squat with load in front rack.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The front squat is a barbell squat variation performed with the bar racked across the front of the
shoulders, primarily targeting the quadriceps with strong core and upper-back demands to maintain an
upright torso. Compared to the back squat, it typically uses lighter loads but encourages a more
upright posture and can be easier on the lower back for some people. To set up, rack the bar on the
front of the shoulders with elbows high and chest lifted, using a clean grip or cross-arm grip.
Brace your core, step into stance, and squat down by bending hips and knees while keeping the elbows
up and torso upright. Descend under control to a comfortable depth, then drive up through the mid-
foot to standing without letting the elbows drop. Context: Accessory strength move. Typically used
to build weak links, volume, or joint-friendly hypertrophy.

- Brace core

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Barbell squat with load on upper back.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The barbell back squat is a compound lower-body exercise performed with a barbell positioned across
the upper back, primarily targeting the quadriceps and glutes with support from the hamstrings,
adductors, and core. It allows for high loading and is commonly used to develop full lower-body
strength and muscle mass, but it requires good mobility and spinal control. To set up, position the
bar in a rack at upper-chest height, step under it, and place it securely across the upper traps or
rear delts depending on comfort. Grip the bar firmly, brace your core, and unrack the bar before
stepping back into a shoulder-width stance with toes slightly turned out. Initiate the squat by
bending hips and knees together, sitting down between your feet while keeping the chest tall and
knees tracking over toes. Descend under control to a comfortable depth, then drive through the mid-
foot and heels to return to standing while maintaining a neutral spine throughout. Context:
Accessory strength move. Typically used to build weak links, volume, or joint-friendly hypertrophy.

- LAST_VERIFIED_DATE: 2025-12-19

COACHING_CUES_SHORT:
- Pause under control

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Squat with deliberate pause at bottom.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The pause squat is a squat variation where you hold the bottom position briefly before standing,
increasing control, stability, and time under tension in the quadriceps and glutes. It is useful for
improving position at depth and reducing reliance on momentum. To perform it, use your chosen squat
style and descend under control to your usual depth, then hold the bottom position for the

COACHING_CUES_SHORT:
- Knee tracks toes

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Rear foot stays planted; split stance squat.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The split squat is a unilateral lower-body exercise performed in a staggered stance, primarily
targeting the quadriceps and glutes of the front leg while improving balance and single-leg control.
It reduces spinal loading compared to bilateral squats and is useful for addressing side-to-side
strength differences. To set up, take a staggered stance with one foot forward and one foot back,
keeping most of your weight over the front foot and your torso upright. Lower your body straight
down by bending both knees, allowing the back knee to move toward the floor while the front knee
tracks over the toes. Descend to a comfortable depth, then push through the front foot to return to
standing with controlled balance throughout the repetition. Context: Primary pattern strength move.
Can be a main lift or a key accessory depending on load and intent.

SAFETY_NOTES:
- Balance before loading.

COMMON_MISTAKES:
- Knee drifting inward.

DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
Split squat with rear foot elevated.

DESCRIPTION_LONG:
The Bulgarian split squat is a unilateral knee-dominant exercise performed with the rear foot
elevated on a bench or box, primarily targeting the quadriceps and glutes of the front leg while
challenging balance and hip stability. It is highly effective for building single-leg strength with
relatively lighter external load than barbell squats. To set up, place the top of your rear foot on
a stable bench behind you and step the front foot forward far enough that you can descend without
the front knee collapsing inward. Lower straight down by bending both knees, keeping the torso tall
and weight over the front foot, then push through the front foot to return to standing under
control. Context: Primary pattern strength move. Can be a main lift or a key accessory depending on
load and intent.

The pike push-up is a bodyweight vertical pressing exercise that primarily targets the shoulders and
triceps while introducing an overhead pressing pattern. It serves as a progression toward handstand
push-ups and an alternative to weighted presses. To set up, start in a push-up position and raise
the hips toward the ceiling so the body forms an inverted V shape. Bend the elbows to lower the head
toward the floor, keeping elbows angled slightly back, then press through the hands to return to the
starting position while maintaining core tension. Context: Primary pattern strength move. Can be a
main lift or a key accessory depending on load and intent.

EXERCISE_ID: cd_0004
EXERCISE: Pool Cooldown Flow
CATEGORY: cooldown
BODY_REGION: full
EQUIPMENT: pool
MOVEMENT_PATTERN: swim, general
PRIMARY_MUSCLES: total_body
COACHING_CUES_SHORT:
  - Stay moving, breathe easy
  - Gentle range, no strain
DESCRIPTION_SHORT:
  In-water cooldown combining gentle movement, mobility, and breathing to reduce heart rate and ease muscle tension.
DESCRIPTION_LONG:
A full-body cooldown designed for completion within the pool after swim, circuit, or hybrid gym +
pool sessions. Keeps heart rate elevated just enough to prevent blood pooling while promoting
recovery and relaxation. Total time: 5–8 minutes. Context: Cool-down/recovery. Use to downshift
breathing and restore range after training.

  1. **Easy Freestyle or Backstroke (2–3 min)** — Swim at very light effort (RPE 2). Focus on long, smooth strokes and relaxed breathing. Feel your heart rate gradually lowering.

  2. **Water Walking or Light Jog (2 min)** — In chest-deep water, walk or jog slowly, allowing arms to swing naturally. Stay tall and breathe evenly. This helps circulate blood and clear metabolites from the legs.

  3. **Wall-Assisted Calf and Hamstring Stretch (1–2 min)** — Facing the pool wall, place both hands on the edge and extend one leg back with heel down to stretch the calf. Alternate legs. Then face away from the wall, place heel on edge, and hinge slightly forward for hamstrings.

  4. **Torso Rotation and Shoulder Sweep (1 min)** — Standing or treading lightly, rotate upper body side to side with arms extended, letting water resistance provide gentle mobility. Feel shoulder and back relaxation.

  5. **Floating Breathing Reset (1–2 min)** — Support yourself in the water (on back or with pool noodle). Inhale slowly through the nose, exhale through pursed lips into the water. Aim for calm, slow exhalations and reduced muscle tension.

  Finish when breathing is calm and muscles feel loose. You should exit the pool feeling relaxed, not chilled or tight.
